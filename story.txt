There once was a fish named Marlin that lived on the great barrier reef.  He was a clown fish with a kid, nemo. They lived in anemone. Then one day nemo went missing. 

Marlin decided to go after his son nemo, and recruited his friend dory to help him out. Dory was really bad at looking but was a very loyal sidekick. All the while nemo had been scooped up by some kid wearing braces who wanted a clown fish as a pet. 

Marlin and Dory were growing increasingly worried as they couldn't find Nemo. They felt defeated once they couldn't find him. However, Dory overcame her short-term memory loss, and Marlin and Dory almost had Nemo back.
